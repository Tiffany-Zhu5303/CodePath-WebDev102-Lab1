# Lab 1: Timetabled

## Overview
In this project, you will build a grid-style calendar with one-hour events that plan out a single week. You must create the calendar for someone else. This can be a friend, family member, historical figure, role model, or imaginary person. Timetables can be informative, humorous, or exploratory. For example:

General: Plan a vacation for a friend, family member, or pet
History: A week in the life of a historical figure, timeline of a coup
Psychology: How to adapt to a polyphasic sleep cycle
True crime: The week before a famous crime
